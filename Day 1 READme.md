# üîß Software to Hardware Flow ‚Äì RISC-V & System Architecture Overview

This repository documents the fundamental flow from **software** (high-level programming languages) to **hardware** (digital logic and gates), with a focus on **RISC-V ISA**, compilers, assemblers, and operating system interactions.

## üß† Key Concepts

| Concept                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Programming Language**    | Human-readable source code like C, C++ |
| **Compiler**                | Converts code to ISA-specific assembly instructions |
| **Assembler**               | Converts assembly to binary (machine code) |
| **Machine Language**        | Binary code executed directly by the CPU |
| **Hexadecimal & Binary**    | Number systems used in lower-level machine representation |
| **ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)** | Defines instructions the CPU can execute |

## üñ•Ô∏è Operating System (OS)

**Examples**: Windows, Linux, macOS

**Responsibilities**:
- Interface between user software and hardware
- Memory management, file systems, I/O, process scheduling
- Converts software tasks to binary instructions for hardware

---

## üß∞ Compiler & Assembler

- **Compiler**: Converts high-level code into assembly code
- **Assembler**: Converts assembly into binary instructions (machine code)

## üß© Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

### RISC-V Variants:

| Variant     | Description                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| RV64I       | 64-bit base integer instructions            |
| RV64IM      | Integer + Multiply/Divide extension         |
| RV64F       | Adds Single-Precision Floating Point        |
| RV64D       | Adds Double-Precision Floating Point        |

## üß™ ABI ‚Äì Application Binary Interface

- Defines register usage and function call conventions
- Common registers: `a0`, `s0`, `sp`, etc.
- Interfaces between compiled application and the OS

---



## üì¶ Hardware Description Language (HDL)

- Used to describe and simulate hardware (e.g., Verilog, VHDL)
- Translates to gate-level models and silicon layouts

---


## ‚ú® Summary

This README explains how a program written in a high-level language is ultimately executed by hardware using a series of transformations through the OS, compiler, assembler, and instruction set. It also introduces the RISC-V ISA and the concept of RTL to GDSII for hardware design.
