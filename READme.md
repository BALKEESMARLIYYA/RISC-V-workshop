# 🚀 RISC-V MYTH Workshop – *Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours*

## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the RISC-V MYTH workshop repository! Here I will document the 5-day online workshop where I learned about the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** and **CPU design** using **TL-Verilog**.

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms

| Tool              | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🧪 TL-Verilog     | Design language for modular digital systems |
| 🖥️ Makerchip     | Web-based IDE for TL-Verilog simulations    |
| 🧵 Spike          | RISC-V ISA simulator                        |
